# Reflections 

## Thursday 13/04

### Initial thoughts:
As a team we just really keen to get stuck into it once the research is done. We are going to be researching at a relatively simular pace to try and speed up the process. Evveryone is just excited to get amongst it a churn out an awesome product, We all have our own research targets and will update the rest of group as tech comes into play. 


## End of day reflections:

### Pros

- Good communications within the group, especially when coming to explaining new tech
- Great progress towards MVP
- Vibes were great
- Git flow went well

### Cons

- Small tech issues due to lack of knowledge with the tech

---

#### We also added deployment to our mvp and are optimistic about reaching that goal

## End of day reflections: 
 
### Pros
- Met personal goals, andrew stoked with getting animations going, reub with his backgrounds etc..
- communication was on point
- wireframe was good and useful
- made good decisions on product and all happy with it

### Cons
- little bit of messing around today without direction or added features without updating kanban
- few technical issues but mostly due to lack of knowlegde with tech

### Thoughts
