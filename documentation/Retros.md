## Thursday 13/04

### Initial thoughts:
As a team we just really keen to get stuck into it once the research is done. We are going to be researching at a relatively simular pace to try and speed up the process. Evveryone is just excited to get amongst it a churn out an awesome product, We all have our own research targets and will update the rest of group as tech comes into play. 


## End of day reflections:

### Pros

- Good communications within the group, especially when coming to explaining new tech
- Great progress towards MVP
- Vibes were great
- Git flow went well

### Cons

- Small tech issues due to lack of knowledge with the tech

---

#### We also added deployment to our mvp and are optimistic about reaching that goal

## End of day reflections:

### Pros
- Big win with sorting deployment
- Individual resarch went really well

## End of day reflections: 
 
### Pros
- Met personal goals, andrew stoked with getting animations going, reub with his backgrounds etc..
- communication was on point
- wireframe was good and useful
- made good decisions on product and all happy with it

### Cons
- little bit of messing around today without direction or added features without updating kanban
- few technical issues but mostly due to lack of knowlegde with tech

### Thoughts
- we are worried that meging all our files might be a big mission so we gonna tackle that in the morning. We will also add new things to the kanbam to keep us on track in the next two days so we not aimlessly working on things.

## Final reflection 19/04

### Pros
-  Happy with final product
-  Team vibes were good
-  Hit MVP early 
-  Used scrums/huddles when neccesary 
-  Lightning talks
-  Figured out git flow early 
-  No major conflicts
-  Decisions were made quickly 
-  Had good kanban
-  Had good wireframe 
-  Had a meeting to resolve scope issue


### Cons
- Using git on windows didnt work
- Could of hit more stretch material if we gave ourselves stricter timelines
- Not everyone got exposure to every part of the project 
- Using new tech meant that we were limited with help
- New tech meant that our code is messy meaning it was harder to debug/change later
- Scope was getting too big for project purpose
