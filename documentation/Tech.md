# Tech Docs

## MVP 

Our MVP will consist of having a basic level with minimal styling. 

Our character which will be a rectangle to start off shoudld be able to:
- Move left and right
- Jump and high jump
- Some form of hit detection 

Enviroment:
- Have some ledges, cliffs and pits for the character to maneuver
- Red box which will damage the player if touched


## Tech we will be using

We will be using Unity for development and Git and Github for collaboration. We may also be using some C++ and C# (Will know more about this after more research).

## Gitflow

Our plan with gitflow will be that there will be a develepment branch where we will split off into solo branches where we will create a test enviroment to play around with features before pushing to development branch. For example person A is working on a double jump feature on their own branch before pushing to development branch when complete.

## Roles

We will use our assigned roles from the wellbeing documentation. In terms of technical roles we will know more about this once we become more fimiliar with the tech that we will be using.

## What might a day look like?

The first day or so will consist of research and getting familiar with unity and git workflow. As a team we plan on going outside and getting lunch most days. When we are all fimiliar the tech the plan is to either split off into pairs or work solo on certain features depending on group needs.

## User stories

As a user I would like to:
- be able to conrol my character to move left and right with the ability to jump
- take damage/die when colliding with objects that have a clear indication of being harmful to the character.
- use the jump feature to navigate obstacles in the level
