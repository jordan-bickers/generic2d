# Generic 2D platformer

!!Dev now used as main!!

- Our [tech](/documentation/Tech.md) documentation
- Our [Retro's](/documentation/Retros.md)

## Wellbeing:

### Check In:
- we're feeling excited for this, a bit nervous to tackle the tech but we think with good teamwork we can acheive a product we are proud of!

---

- breaks (knowing you can take those when you think you need them)
- being open and honest with each other, any time your feeling stressed, etc.
- giving eachother space when we need it.
- taking the small wins as a chance for a break, so we can actually celebrate and savour these.
- having huddles (seperate from standups) to check in on eachother aswell as shoulder taps if we think anyone is struggling.
- be flexible, we all know the plan will change and doingretros daily will let us adapt to thr challanges we face daily
- watch if anyone seems too quiet or is being short with others, could indicate stress. We've said we should check in on eachother and give eachother space if requested.

### Stress profiles:
- Reuben : Tends to stay quiet and struggle alone and getting tunnel vision on the problem without asking for help. A quick shoulder tap should bring me back into play - with the group and i can then explain what's going on.
- Andrew : Will also be quiet and not communicate as much, to help someone should just check in to see if I am all good.
- Isaac : Relatively low stress profile, will get short with people when he starts to feel stress and wants time by himself to cool off.
- Jordan : Gets short with people and has a lot less patience, just want space as well to cool off. Can also get tunnel visioned on a task and will prefer to finish it before taking a break.

### Expectation setting and agreements:
- we're going to work 9-5, if you want to work outside this time keep it to your own part of the project and communicate with the team what you're doing.
- communication will mostly be group discussions as we are a small enough group for that, but we can opt out if we dont think we need to be there and have a tldr in the slack.
- we'll do work on sunday but only if we havent hit mvp by end of friday.

### Conflict Resolution: 
- take a break from the code and have an honest chat about the issues we are having without judgement and work on a resolution plan together whilst applying NVC (non violent communication). Use of a facilitator if things get particularly rough. We feel that if we stick to our keep it 100 (honest yarns) these problems wont happen but these are the step we will take if they arise.

### Decision making: 
- we are going to have very small discussions as a group then if still undecided Jordan and Reuben will then make a decision amongst themselves. The others will be present for these decisions but ultimately we are going to try keep them short and sweet. The roles Jordan and Reub play can be shifted around and aren't set it stone. Most decisions will be quite fluid due to the new tech we are using which allows more flexibility in our decision making process.

### Working hours: 
- our agreement is to work during dev hours to simulate a work environment (9-5). If needed or wanted people are able to work on a specific task outside of the hours as long as they have the OK from the rest of the group and can communicate with the group about what they achieved the next day.

### Getting help:
- formulate our questions before asking them.
- 15minutes of self struggle, 15 minutes of group struggle, then ask facilitators for help.
- non technically, asking Patch or Joseph to sit in on a huddle or do a check in with them to make a plan to sort whatever issue has arisen.

### How do you make sure everyone feels included:
- standups dont end until everyone knows what theyre doing and have had a chance to speak.
- using huddles to check up on eachother.
- making group decisions and inviting everyone to those.
- we think that initially it would be easier to be coding in pairs in order to learn the tech in play, as we get more used to the tech we think that it will be beneficial to split off into solos/pairs
 if needed once we get our heads around the tech.

### Survival:
- inviting everyone to lunch, but still leaving it open for the to decline.
- team building outside of dev in the form of games.
- entertainment (drinks, etc)
